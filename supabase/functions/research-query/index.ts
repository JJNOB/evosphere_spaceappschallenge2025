Title: Mice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission: Training and Selection

Abstract:
After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of ''space'' paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.

Research Paper Content:
${RESEARCH_CONTENT}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For the SUMMARY section:
   - Write it in an academic introduction style, similar to a literature review
   - ALWAYS cite authors when mentioning findings (e.g., "Smith et al. demonstrated that...", "According to Johnson and Lee...")
   - Focus ONLY on the most important and significant findings
   - Be concise - prioritize quality over quantity of information
   - If multiple papers cover the same topic, synthesize them into cohesive paragraphs rather than listing everything
   - Use proper academic tone and structure

2. For KEY FINDINGS:
   - List the 3-5 most critical discoveries with author citations
   - Use bullet points with brief explanations

3. For CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Only mention significant debates or conflicting results between studies
   - Cite the authors of conflicting studies

4. If the query is NOT related to the research content, indicate that no relevant information was found and suggest what topics ARE covered in the database.`
